# Template Application
Hola, this is a template application we'll be updating with stuff over time. Ideally, you'd
want to use this template for inspiration when making an app. However, you don't always have
to agree with everything we write here. In fact, it's encouraged you hack away as much
as you like.

Or you could always use the template provided by Android Studio. 

# Making it your own
When you use the template, you have to change a few things. Namely, they're:
- `applicationId` in the `build.gradle` file
- `package` attribute in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file
- Reorganize the directory structure in the `src` folder to map directly to your package attribute
- Change the values for `compileSdkVersion` and `buildToolsVersion` in the `build.gradle` file. We'll try to be as up to date with the current build tools possible. Or if you want to use an older version, that's cool too.
- Stuff in the `build.gradle` file. Seriously, add as many dependencies, modifications, etc., as you want.
