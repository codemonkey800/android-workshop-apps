# SJSU Android Workshop 
This be the repo for the Android Workshop. Every week, we'll be posting 
the example apps here and updating the template app over time.

# Getting the Apps
Hopefully you know Git. Each app is located on their own branch, as well as the template app.

To pull an app, run the command:
```
    git pull -b <app> https://github.com/codemonkey800/sjsu-android-workshop.git <app>
```

# Template App
We've also included a template app that we'll be updating over time. If you want to get that,
run this:
```
    git pull -b template https://github.com/codemonkey800/sjsu-android-workshop.git template
```

Refer to the README.md file in the `template` directory so you'll know how to make the app
your own. Or read it [here](https://github.com/codemonkey800/sjsu-android-workshop/tree/template).
