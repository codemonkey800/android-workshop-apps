<!--
    Strings should always be stored in a strings.xml file. This helps with
    translating because you can create multiple values folders, such as
    values-en which would be values for a user using Spanish on his or her phone.

    For example, when referring to the variable hello_world, Android will get the correct
    String resource depending on the user's language, but it will refer to the same variable.
-->
<resources>
    <string name="app_name">TestApp</string>

    <string name="hello_world">Hello world!</string>
    <string name="action_settings">Settings</string>
</resources>
