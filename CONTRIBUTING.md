# Contributing
If you're awesome and Android and want to teach people stuff. Message me and I'll add you as a contributor. Then you can can post the weekly example apps here. 

# Rules
Okay they're not really rules but just stuff I'd like for you to do
- Remove unnecessary code, files, etc. When creating a new project, it sometimes generates stuff we don't need, like menus. So if it's not relevant to the tutorial for that week, please delete it so that we save as much repo space as possible
- Add comments to your code so that people can understand it
- Add a README.md file giving an overview of that week. Don't go too in depth since your comments should be able to do it.
